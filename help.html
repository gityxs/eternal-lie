        <h2>Help! I have no idea what's going on!</h2>
        <p>so I thought that a Lovecraft themed game shouldn't be too straightforward. You begin as a simple researcher, Dr. West -no relation- in possession of an ancient manuscript. You can learn many things from this Tome including how to control others, using them for your own gain. Eventually you will gain access to eldritch beings, sacrifice your followers or their families and be granted immense power and immortality in return.</p>
        <p>Professor West's Actions require different inputs.</p>
        <p>West's Charm will allow you to influence others. His Vision will unlock new abilities. Radiance is Power granted to or stolen by him. Last, Madness is inevitable. Finding a way to stay sane is the only path forward. Madness can have detrimental effects including MadLock, which only passes by regaining some sanity.</p> 
        <p>West's cult has many purposes, but chanting is the most basic. Assigning a cultist is permanent, as the work warps their minds, leaving them useless for any other task. Any follower may be sacrificed to the Dark Gods, and the rewards will vary.</p>
