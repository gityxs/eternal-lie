/* 
*Through the ghoul-guarded gateways of slumber,
Past the wan-mooned abysses of night,
I have lived o'er my lives without number,
I have sounded all things with my sight.
 * 
 * â€œI have seen the dark universe yawning, where the black planets roll without aim, where they roll in their horror, unheeded, without knowledge or luster or name
 *
